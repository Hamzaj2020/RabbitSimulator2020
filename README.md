# RabbitSimulator2020
Rabbit simulation task

## Phase 1

## Sprint 0 (14.00 - 14.20, 27 Jan 2020)
* Asked qns to Manish

## Sprint 1 (14.20 - 14.55, 27 Jan 2020)
* Created github repository
* Created user stories:
  * US1: As a User I want to give a time period of the simulation so that I know how many Rabbits are alive at the end of the simulation.
  * US2: As a User I want to know how many rabbits have died by the end of the simulation so that I can analyse how many have died in the time period I have given.
  * US3: As a User I want to know how many male and female rabbits are alive at the end of the simulation so that I can analyse the  characteristics of the rabbits that are alive.
  * US4: As a User I want to know the average age of live Rabbits by the end of the simulation so that I can analyse the characteristics of the rabbits that are alive.
* Created high level tasks for backlog
* Created Trello board
### Successes
* Created and found importance in user stories
* Comprehended what a user wanted
* Able to derive task backlog using user stories
* Organised with what tasks were completed by whom
### Improvements
* Communication - talked over eachother
* Initially not working as a team

## Sprint 2 (15.05 - 15.45 (+10mins), 27 Jan 2020)
* Created abstract class for rabbit
  * Constructor and basic methods
* Basic rabbit tests
### Successes
* Gained ideas
* Started with code
* Improved understanding of rabbit class
* Learned new methods to test case
* Improved team listening
### Improvements
* Lack of adhering to SOLID princliples (S)
* Did not start testing in time

## Sprint 3 (16.07 - 17.00, 27 Jan 2020)
* Created rabbit lifecycle class, RabbitContainer class
* Finished testing Rabbit class (checked isMature, gender)
* Found fixes for some tested methods
### Successes
* Adhered to SOLID principles better
### Improvements
* Should better team/pair programming practices
* Would like to improve communicationi within sub-groups

## Sprint 4 (09.15 - 10.20 (+15mins), 28 Jan 2020)
* Death of rabbits
* Managing time (increaseTime(), increaseRabbitAge())
* Updating and fixing code 
### Successes
* Worked well within sub-teams
### Improvements
* Struggling to share code between teams when both teams are working on the same classes

## Sprint 5 (10.30 - 11.30, 28 Jan 2020)
* Establish gender equality amongst rabbits
* Accept user input (console inputs)
* Testing previous sprint 4 work
* Remove "dead rabbits" array (Death counter implemented)
### Successes
* Good support given to team members
### Improvements
* Overran sprint by a few mins
* Have not managed to kill rabbits after making changes to this implementation

## Sprint 6 (11.35 - 12.00, 28 Jan 2020)
* Finish/polish accepting user input
* Complete killing rabbits
* Complete long-term backlog
### Successes
* Finished all sprint tasks early
* Basic refactoring/mergeing code
### Improvements
* Did not look for grammatical errors

## Sprint 7 (12.00 - 12.45 (+60mins), 28 Jan 2020)
* Basic code refactoring
* Ensure entire group understands code
### Successes
* Better understanding about the implementation of the project
* Learning different approaches for tackling errors
* Everyone understands code
### Improvements
* Merge work regularly to avoid repetition

## Sprint 8 (13.50 - 14.30, 28 Jan 2020)
* Write tests for all classes
* Complete implementation for breeding rabbits
### Successes
* Progress made with breeding rabbits
### Improvements
* Difficulty finding more tests to perform

## Sprint 9 (14.30 - 15.40 (+10mins), 28 Jan 2020)
* Continue with tests
* Refactor code
* Fixing outOfMemory errors
### Successes
* Good research performed
### Improvements
* Communication between both groups

## Sprint 10 (15.50 - 17.00, 28 Jan 2020)
